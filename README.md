erlang Cookbook
===============

We don't actually need to run anything from the community erlang
cookbook, yet some community cookbooks depend on it.

This cookbook is an attempt to do as little as possible, breaking
as few things as possible.

## Recipes

By doing as little as possible, we mean that this recipe should do **nothing**.
If you are trying to install something that isn't a package that already
declares its dependency on the correct version of erlang, woe onto you. Maybe
try the **package** recipe. Maybe. Good luck.

## Versions

This cookbook is set with a version very far into the future (2000), so
that it should always appear newer than the community version of the
cookbook.
