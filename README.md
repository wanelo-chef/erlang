erlang Cookbook
===============

We don't actually need to run anything from the community erlang
cookbook, yet some community cookbooks depend on it.

This cookbook is an attempt to do as little as possible, breaking
as few things as possible.

## Versions

This cookbook is set with a version very far into the future (2000), so
that it should always appear newer than the community version of the
cookbook.
